        <h1>Check out my borders</h1>
        <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px<br>
            radius.<br>
            Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.
        </p>
        <hr id="hr2-8">
        <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;<br>
            all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.<br>
            <br>
            Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br>
            That prevents it from messing with the line height.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
            <div class="red-border">This div has a red border</div>
            <div class="blue-border">This div has a blue border</div>
            <p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
            <div id="red-border1">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
            <div id="blue-border1">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
    </body>
